As my final year project, I designed a people counting system to count the number of people entering or leaving monitored zone using two approaches :

1. Using RaspberryPi and USB Webcam
2. Using IR Sensors and Arduino UNO

Research paper for the same can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9670970)
